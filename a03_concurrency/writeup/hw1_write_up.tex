% The following two environments (theorem, proof) are
% where you will enter the statement and proof of your
% first problem for this assignment.
%
% In the theorem environment, you can replace the word
% "theorem" in the \begin and \end commands with
% "exercise", "problem", "lemma", etc., depending on
% what you are submitting. Replace the "x.yz" with the
% appropriate number for your problem.
%
% If your problem does not involve a formal proof, you
% can change the word "proof" in the \begin and \end
% commands with "solution".

\section*{Questions}

\begin{question}{1}
What do you think the main point of this assignment is?
\end{question}
I think that the main point of this assignment was honed our parallel-thinking skills. The ability to think of a thread while keeping in mind other threads is complex. The reason why programming multiple threads are complex is that you have to think about how the various threads will interact with each other. In the case of this assignment, there were three threads that were accessing one single linked list. So, the main point of this assignment was to become familiar and appreciate the interactions of multiple threads selecting, inserting, and deleting data. In addition, the other main point of this assignment was to hone our interpersonal skills. Working with a partner throughout this assignment has allowed us to understand and appreciate the roles of a leader and a follower. Also, we were able to criticize each other's code without offending one another.

% Second problem
% -----------------------------------------------------

\vspace{0.25in} % This just adds some space between problems 1 and 2.

\begin{question}{2}
How did you personally approach the problem? Design decisions, algorithm, etc.
\end{question}
How we approached the problem for this concurrency assignment was using problem-solving techniques. First, we needed to understand the problem. We identified, for part two, that we needed to have three different functions that would act as a selector, inserter, and deleter, respectively. In addition, we understood that the single linked list would be the source of information so a basic structure needed to be implemented and initialized. For the second step, we designed the three main threads that would be involved in this assignment. The threads needed to be cohesive so when a thread would be called upon, it would do its objective. Further, we then implemented our design.  

% -----------------------------------------------------
% Third problem
% -----------------------------------------------------

\vspace{0.25in} % This adds some space between problems 2 and 3.

\begin{question}{3}
How did you ensure your solution was correct? Testing details, for instance.
\end{question}
The way we ensured that our solution was correct was by checking that each thread worked properly. For example, the selector thread printed out a random node from the single linked list; the inserter thread inserted created a node and inserted it at the end of the single linked list. However, the deleter thread was created to randomly delete a node from the single linked list; but, for some reason, it would crash after a few minutes of execution. However, this problem was fixed by delaying the deleter thread for a few seconds more than the speed of insertion of the inserter. As a result, there was always a single linked list. Then after running the program once more, every thread reported itself--by the printf function, this allowed us to identify that each of the threads was executing.

% Fourth problem
%----------------------------------------------------------

\vspace{0.25in}
\begin{question}{4}
What did you learn?
\end{question}
What we learned from this assignment were many ideas. First, there is a large amount of useful information on the web. Sometimes, you need to search many sources in order to come to a conclusion about what is the best approach to design or implement a function. In addition, it helps tremendously to pull out a sheet of paper and scribble around to pull out a solution. This saved us a large amount of time. Further, it also helps to take a walk and not think about the problem. Sometimes you need some fresh air; and maybe as a result, you end up finding a valid solution.
